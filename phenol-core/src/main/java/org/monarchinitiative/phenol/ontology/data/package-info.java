/**
 * Data structures for generic representation of ontologies.
 *
 * <p>The API has been designed around the following principles:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The API should follow the principle of least surprise, i.e., offer consistency.
 *   <li>Redundancies should be kept to a minimum, in some places, it is possible functions are
 *       offered for obtaining {@link java.util.Collection} or a {@link java.util.Iterator},
 *       depending on the user's requirements.
 *   <li>The API deals with {@link org.monarchinitiative.phenol.ontology.data.TermId}s on the graph
 *       level. These are then linked to more richly attributed {@link
 *       org.monarchinitiative.phenol.ontology.data.Term}s through {@link java.util.Map}s.
 *   <li>The central classes offer relatively minimal interfaces, decorator classes are used for
 *       providing more extended behaviour.
 *   <li>Even more complex behaviour is available in the <code>
 *       org.monarchinitiative.phenol.ontology.algo</code> package in a one-class-per-algorithm
 *       fashion, similar to the separation between graph data structures and graph algorithms.
 * </ul>
